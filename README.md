I discoverd that you can get physically **small MOSFETs**, in a TO92 package, but how do they stack up agains the traditional BJT NON transistors that we've used for years?

So we can try a small experiment to see what load they can switch and, most importantly, whether they can switch on at the **TTL level** 5v like their bigger (TO220 package) brethren.

And what about their **RDS(on)** spec? A large MOSFET might have an on-resistance of only 0.02 ohms, perfect to allow it to carry large currents without melting whilst it does so. What about these little 2N7000 devices though?

And how **expensive** are they? Do they compare well with their BJT counterparts? Or is there a price premium to pay?

Then again, 10 pieces of a common BJT NON transistor are pretty cheap:
